    <h5>Elyza is an accomplished musician, who started her career in college honing her craft of classical French horn and singing musical theatre tunes. After 11 years of french horn and music theory, she dropped it all to sing rock n’ roll and jam on her tenor ukulele. But the pulses of distortion kept calling her back, and she’s been enjoying rocking out on a good old Truetone from the 60s ever since.</h5>
