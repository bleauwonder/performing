<h5>Okay, so I was basically in a personal lockdown before March of 2020 anyway. I had moved away from the city into a bungalow on the beach. I was working 2 full-time jobs but that fierce independence led me to show up to my guitar every day in january. After 4 years of struggling to write, I wrote 21 songs in 30 days. I was going to make an EP and I had spent the last month and a half choosing the best ones to craft. And thenâ€¦all hell broke loose on earth. </h5>
